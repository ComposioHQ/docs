<Steps>
    <Step title="Run the `setup.sh` file">
    > Fork and Clone this [repository](https://git.new/composio), Navigate to the Project Directory 
   
   `cd cookbook/examples/python/research_assistant`

    Make the setup.sh Script Executable (if necessary): On Linux or macOS, you might need to make the setup.sh script executable:
    <CodeGroup>
        ```bash Run Command
       chmod +x setup.sh

       # run the setup.sh file
       ./setup.sh
        ```
        Fill in the .env file after running the script.
    </CodeGroup>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Importing required libraries">
    Now, import the necessary libraries in your Python script:
    <CodeGroup>
        ```python Import statements
        from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, Process
        from composio_langchain import ComposioToolSet, App
        from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
        import os
        import dotenv
        ```
    </CodeGroup>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Initialise Language Model and Define tools">
    We'll initialize our language model and set up the necessary tools for our agents.
    We will be using serpapi tool, So that our agent can execute actions using this tool.    
    <CodeGroup>
        ```python LLM and Tools 
        # Load environment variables
        dotenv.load_dotenv()

        # Initialize the language model with OpenAI API key and model name
        llm = ChatOpenAI(
            openai_api_key=os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"],
            model_name="gpt-4o"
        )
        # Setup tools using ComposioToolSet
        composio_toolset = ComposioToolSet()
        #Using .get_tools we are able to add various tools needed by the agents to execute its objective
        #in this case its serpapi, giving the agent access to the internet
        tools = composio_toolset.get_tools(apps=[App.SERPAPI])
        ```
    </CodeGroup>

    </Step>

   <Step title="Defining the Agent">
   Define the Researcher agent with the necessary parameters:
   <CodeGroup>
       ```python Agents
        researcher = Agent(
            role='Researcher',
            goal='Search the internet for the information requested',
            backstory="""
            You are a researcher. Using the information in the task, you find out some of the most popular facts about the topic along with some of the trending aspects.
            You provide a lot of information thereby allowing a choice in the content selected for the final blog.
            """,
            verbose=True,
            allow_delegation=False,
            tools=tools,
            llm=llm
        )
       ```

   </CodeGroup>
   </Step>

    <Step title="Defining the Task">
    Create and execute a task for the agent:
    <CodeGroup>
        ```python Execute
        task1 = Task( description="""Research about open source LLMs vs
            closed source LLMs. Your final answer MUST be a full analysis report""", #To
            change the topic, edit the text after 'Research about' in the description
            parameter of task1 expected_output='When the research report is ready',
            agent=researcher
        )
        task1.execute()
        ```
    </CodeGroup>
    </Step>

</Steps>

## Putting It All Together

Below is the complete code snippet combining all the steps:

<CodeGroup>
    ```python Final Code
    from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, Process
    from composio_langchain import ComposioToolSet, App
    from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
    import os
    import dotenv

    # Load environment variables
    dotenv.load_dotenv()

    # Initialize the language model with OpenAI API key and model name
    llm = ChatOpenAI(
        openai_api_key=os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"],
        model_name="gpt-4o"
    )

    # Setup tools using ComposioToolSet
    composio_toolset = ComposioToolSet()
    #Using .get_tools we are able to add various tools needed by the agents to execute its objective
    #in this case its serpapi, giving the agent access to the internet
    tools = composio_toolset.get_tools(apps=[App.SERPAPI])

    # Define the Researcher agent with its role, goal, and backstory
    researcher = Agent(
        role='Researcher',
        goal='Search the internet for the information requested',
        backstory="""
        You are a researcher. Using the information in the task, you find out some of the most popular facts about the topic along with some of the trending aspects.
        You provide a lot of information thereby allowing a choice in the content selected for the final blog.
        """,
        verbose=True,  # Enable verbose logging for the agent
        allow_delegation=False,  # Disable delegation
        tools=tools,  # Assign the tools to the agent
        llm=llm  # Assign the language model to the agent
    )

    # Define the research task with its description and expected output
    task1 = Task(
        description="""
        Research about open source LLMs vs closed source LLMs.
        Your final answer MUST be a full analysis report
        """, #you can add your own topic after "Research about {your topic}"
        expected_output='When the research report is ready',  # Define the expected output
        agent=researcher  # Assign the task to the researcher agent
    )

    # Execute the task
    task1.execute()

    # Print the result of the task execution
    print(task1.result)
    ```
