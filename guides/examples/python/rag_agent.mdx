description: "This guide provides detailed steps to create an agent that leverages Composio to add content to a RAG tool, perform retrieval-augmented generation queries, and return relevant information based on user input."
---

This project involves setting up and running a system of agents to add content to a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) tool, perform queries, and return relevant information. We use Composio to set up the tools and OpenAI GPT-4o to power the agents. Follow this guide to set up and run the project.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Run the `setup.sh` file">
    > Fork and Clone this [repository](https://git.new/composio), Navigate to the Project Directory 

    `cd cookbook/examples/rag_agent`

    Make the setup.sh Script Executable (if necessary): On Linux or macOS, you might need to make the setup.sh script executable:
    <CodeGroup>
        ```bash Run Command
       chmod +x setup.sh

       # run the setup.sh file
       ./setup.sh
        ```
        Fill in the .env file after running the script.
    </CodeGroup>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Imports and Environment Setup">
    In your Python script, import the necessary libraries and set up your environment variables.
    <CodeGroup>
        ```python
        import os
        import dotenv
        from textwrap import dedent
        from composio_langchain import Action, App, ComposioToolSet
        from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
        from composio.local_tools import ragtool

        # Load environment variables
        dotenv.load_dotenv()
        ```
    </CodeGroup>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Initialize Language Model and Define Tools">
    Initialize the language model with OpenAI API key and model name, and set up the necessary tools for the agents.
    <CodeGroup>
        ```python LLM and Tools
        # Initialize the LLM with the OpenAI GPT-4o model and API key
        llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o", openai_api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

        # Initialize the Composio ToolSet with the API key
        toolset = ComposioToolSet(api_key=os.getenv("COMPOSIO_API_KEY"))

        # Get the RAG tool from the Composio ToolSet
        tools = toolset.get_tools(apps=[App.RAGTOOL])
        ```
    </CodeGroup>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Define the RAG Agent">
    Define the RAG agent with its role, goal, backstory, and tools.
    <CodeGroup>
        ```python Agents
        # Define the RAG Agent
        rag_agent = Agent(
            role="RAG Agent",
            goal=dedent(
                """\
                Add relevant content to the RAG tool to enrich its knowledge base.
                Formulate a query to retrieve information from the RAG tool based on user input.
                After retrieval and addition of content, evaluate whether the goal given by the user input is achieved. If yes, stop execution."""
            ),
            verbose=True,
            memory=True,
            backstory=dedent(
                """\
                You are an expert in understanding user requirements, forming accurate queries,
                and enriching the knowledge base with relevant content."""
            ),
            llm=llm,
            allow_delegation=False,
            tools=tools,
        )
        ```
    </CodeGroup>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Define Tasks for Adding Content">
    Create tasks to add content to the RAG tool for enriching its knowledge base.

            "Berlin is the capital of Germany. It is famous for its history and vibrant culture.",
            "Tokyo is the capital of Japan. It is known for its technology and cuisine.",
            "Canberra is the capital of Australia. It is known for its modern architecture and museums.",
            # Add more data as needed
        ]

        # Define the task for adding content to the RAG tool
        add_content_tasks = [
            Task(
                description=dedent(
                    f"""\
                    Add the following content to the RAG tool to enrich its knowledge base: {content}"""
                ),
                expected_output="Content was added to the RAG tool",
                tools=tools,

                allow_delegation=False,
            )
            for content in additional_content_list
        ]
        ```
    </CodeGroup>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Define and Execute Query Task">
    Create and execute the task for querying the RAG tool based on user input.
    <CodeGroup>
        ```python Query task
        # User-provided query
        user_query = "What is the capital of France?"

        # Define the task for executing the RAG tool query
        query_task = Task(
            description=dedent(
                f"""\
                Formulate a query based on this input: {user_query}.
                Retrieve relevant information using the RAG tool and return the results."""
            ),
            expected_output="Results of the RAG tool query were returned. Stop once the goal is achieved.",
            tools=tools,
            agent=rag_agent,
            allow_delegation=False,
        )
        ```
    </CodeGroup>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Create Crew and Execute Process">

    <CodeGroup>
        ```python Final step
        # Define the crew with the agent and tasks
        crew = Crew(
            agents=[rag_agent],
            tasks=[add_content_tasks ,query_task],
            process=Process.sequential,
