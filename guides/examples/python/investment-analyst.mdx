description: "This guide provides detailed steps to create an Investment Analyst Agent that leverages CrewAI, Composio 
to perform investment research, analyze stocks, and offer recommendations based on user input"
---
This project involves setting up and running a system of agents to conduct investment research, analyze the research, and provide investment recommendations. We use Crewai to setup the Agents, Composio is used to add the tools we need, in this case we need SERP. Follow this guide to set up and run the project.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Run the `setup.sh` file">
    > Fork and Clone this [repository](https://git.new/composio), Navigate to the Project Directory 

    `cd cookbook/examples/investment_analyst`

    Make the setup.sh Script Executable (if necessary): On Linux or macOS, you might need to make the setup.sh script executable:
    <CodeGroup>
        ```bash Run Command
       chmod +x setup.sh

       # run the setup.sh file
       ./setup.sh
        ```
        Fill in the .env file after running the script.
    </CodeGroup>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Imports and Environment Setup">
    In your Python script, import the necessary libraries and set up your environment variables.
    <CodeGroup>
        ```python Import statements
        from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, Process
        from composio_langchain import ComposioToolSet, App
        from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
        import os
        import dotenv        
        ```
    </CodeGroup>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Initialise Language Model and Define tools">
    We'll initialize our language model and set up the necessary tools for our agents.
    We will be using serpapi tool, So that our agent can execute actions using this tool.    
    <CodeGroup>
        ```python LLM and Tools
        # Load environment variables
        dotenv.load_dotenv()

        # Initialize the language model with OpenAI API key and model name
        llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY", "default_key"), model_name="gpt-4o")

        # Setup tools using ComposioToolSet
        composio_toolset = ComposioToolSet()
        #Using .get_tools we are able to add various tools needed by the agents to execute its objective
        #in this case its serpapi, giving the agent access to the internet
        tools = composio_toolset.get_tools(apps=[App.SERPAPI])
        ```

</CodeGroup>
</Step>

   <Step title="Defining the Agent">
   Define the roles and goals of our agents. There are four agents in use here: Investment Researcher, Investment Analyst, and Investment Recommender agents.
   <CodeGroup>
       ```python Agents
        # Define the Investment Researcher agent
        researcher = Agent(
            role='Investment Researcher',
            goal='Use SERP to research the top 2 results based on the input given to you and provide a report',
            backstory="""
            You are an expert Investment researcher. Using the information given to you, conduct comprehensive research using
            various sources and provide a detailed report. Don't pass in location as an argument to the tool
            """,
            verbose=True,
            allow_delegation=True,
            tools=tools,
            llm=llm
        )
        # Define the Investment Analyst agent
        analyser = Agent(
            role='Investment Analyst',
            goal='Analyse the stock based on information available to it, use all the tools',
            backstory="""
            You are an expert Investment Analyst. You research on the given topic and analyse your research for insights.
            Note: Do not use SERP when you're writing the report
            """,
            verbose=True,
            tools=tools,
            llm=llm
        )

        # Define the Investment Recommender agent
        recommend = Agent(
            role='Investment Recommendation',
            goal='Based on the analyst insights, you offer recommendations',
            backstory="""
            You are an expert Investment Recommender. You understand the analyst insights and with your expertise suggest and offer
            advice on whether to invest or not. List the Pros and Cons as bullet points
            """,
            verbose=True,
            tools=tools,
            llm=llm
        )

        ```

   </CodeGroup>
   </Step>

    <Step title="Defining the Task and Kickoff the Process">
    Create a task for the analyst agent and execute the process.
    <CodeGroup>
        ```python Execute
        # Get user input for the research topic
        user_input = input("Please provide a topic: ")

        # Define the task for the analyst agent
        analyst_task = Task(
            description=f'Research on {user_input}',
            agent=analyser,
            expected_output="When the input is well researched, thoroughly analysed and recommendation is offered"
        )

        # Create the crew with the defined agents and task
        investment_crew = Crew(
            agents=[researcher, analyser, recommend],
            tasks=[analyst_task],
            verbose=1,
            full_output=True,
        )

        # Execute the process

        res = investment_crew.kickoff()

        ```

</CodeGroup>
</Step>
