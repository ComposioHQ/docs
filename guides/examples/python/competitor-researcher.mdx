description: "This guide will walk you through setting up a system that scrapes competitor websites
and automatically adds detailed research notes to your Notion workspace. Let's get started!"
---
This project uses Composio to automate the creation and management of competitor pages in Notion. It scrapes data from competitor websites and generates Notion pages under a specified parent page. If a page with the same name already exists, a unique identifier is added. This ensures that your competitor information in Notion is always up-to-date and well-organized.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Run the `setup.sh` file">
    > Fork and Clone this [repository](https://git.new/composio), Navigate to the Project Directory 

    `cd cookbook/examples/competitor_researcher`

    Make the setup.sh Script Executable (if necessary): On Linux or macOS, you might need to make the setup.sh script executable:
    <CodeGroup>
        ```bash Run Command
       chmod +x setup.sh

       # run the setup.sh file
       ./setup.sh
        ```
    Fill in the .env file after running the script.
    </CodeGroup>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Import base packages">
    In your Python script, import the required libraries:
    <CodeGroup>
        ```python Import statements
        import os, re, time, requests, base64, dotenv
        from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
        from datetime import datetime
        from flask import Flask, jsonify
        from openai import OpenAI, OpenAIError
        from composio_crewai import ComposioToolSet, App, ComposioSDK
        from crewai import Agent, Task
        from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
        ```
    </CodeGroup>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Initialise Language Model and Define tools">
     We'll initialize our language model and set up the necessary tools for our agents.
    <CodeGroup>
        ```python LLM and Tools
        # Load environment variables
        dotenv.load_dotenv()
        openai_api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
        model = os.getenv("MODEL")
        # URL of the competitor website
        url = os.getenv("URL")
        # actual parent page in Notion
        parent_page = os.getenv("NOTION_PARENT_PAGE")


        # Initialize the language model
        llm = ChatOpenAI(model=model, api_key=openai_api_key)

        # Define tools for the agents using the ComposioToolSet
        composio_toolset = ComposioToolSet()
        tools = composio_toolset.get_tools(apps=[App.NOTION])

        # Retrieve the current date and time
        date = datetime.today().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
        timezone = datetime.now().astimezone().tzinfo
        ```
    </CodeGroup>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Scrape Webpage">
    Define a function to scrape the competitor's website and extract the information you need.
    - Helper function `remove_tags(html)` uses BeautifulSoup to remove HTML tags from a string, returning clean text.
    - `scrape_website(url)` function fetches content from the specified URL. This function uses requests to get the webpage, processes the HTML content to remove tags, and returns the cleaned text. Handles potential request errors gracefully.
    <CodeGroup>
        ```python Web Scraper        
        # Function to remove HTML tags from a string using BeautifulSoup
        def remove_tags(html):
            soup = BeautifulSoup(html, "html.parser")
            return soup.get_text()


        # Function to scrape website content
        def scrape_website(url):
            try:
                response = requests.get(url)
                response.raise_for_status()  # Check if the request was successful
                html_content = response.content.decode("utf-8")  # Decode content to a string
                cleaned_content = remove_tags(html_content)
                return cleaned_content
            except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
                return f"An error occurred while requesting the URL: {e}"
        ```
    </CodeGroup>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Create and Execute Agent">
    Set up the agent that will interact with Notion and create the required pages with the scraped data.
    <CodeGroup>
        ```python Run agent
        # Initialize the agent with specific role and goal
        agent = Agent(
            role="Notion Agent",
            goal="Take action on Notion.",
            backstory="You are an AI Agent with access to Notion",
            verbose=True,
            tools=tools,
            llm=llm,
        )

        # Scrape data from the competitor website
        competitor_data = scrape_website(url)

        # Define the task for the agent
        task = Task(
            description=f"Create a page for the competitor with the specified name. If a page with the same name already exists, append a unique identifier as a prefix or suffix. Create the page under '{parent_page}', if the parent page '{parent_page}' doesn't exist, find the most suitable parent page among existing pages. Place the pointers given to you in the created page without altering them. \nPointers to be included in the page: {competitor_data}. \nYour task ends only after successfully putting in the pointers in the page that you created.",
            expected_output="List down the contents of the page and title of the page created.",
            agent=agent,
            async_execution=True,
        )

        # Execute the task, and see the page in notion get populated!
        task.execute()    
        ```

    </CodeGroup>
    </Step>

</Steps>
