## Using Triggers

**Prerequisite**: Successfully **linking an account** & then having `connectedAccountId`.

Triggers are predefined conditions that, when met, initiate webhooks to your agents. 
These webhooks usually contain payload which cn be used to our advantage. Some of the examples:
* Github Commit Event: Triggers a webhook whenever there is a new commit made to a particular repository.
* Youtube New Item In Playlist: Triggers a webhook whenever a new video has been added to a youtube playlist.


Check out the coding guides provided in the examples section to have a better understanding.

## **Types of Triggers**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Default Triggers (Preferred)">
    Composio supports a variety of default triggers for each supported
    application. Check them out by going to the app page.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Custom Triggers (Build your Own)">
    Our platform offers an extensible interface for defining custom triggers for
    both custom and default applications. [**Coming Soon**](#)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Getting Started with Triggers

<CodeGroup>
``` Bash Triggers Help
# In CLI
composio triggers --help
```
</CodeGroup>

<CodeGroup>
``` Bash Result
üìÑList triggers available for your account

 üîó Options 

--active    Only list the active triggers
--id TEXT   Filter by trigger id
--app TEXT  Filter by app name

üìô Examples:

composio triggers              # List all triggers
composio triggers --active     # List only active triggers
composio triggers --id 12345   # List trigger with specific ID
composio triggers --app MyApp  # List triggers for a specific app
```
</CodeGroup>

## Listing Default Triggers

<CodeGroup>
``` Bash Get List of Triggers
# In CLI
composio triggers
```
</CodeGroup>

The response will be a list of all triggers.

<CodeGroup>
```Bash List of all Triggers 
github_issue_added_event
‚Ä¢ slackbot_receive_message
‚Ä¢ slackbot_receive_thread_reply
‚Ä¢ slackbot_reaction_removed
‚Ä¢ slackbot_reaction_added
....
```
</CodeGroup>

## Setting Up Triggers

To set up triggers, follow these steps:

1. **Set Universal Callback URL**: Define a universal callback URL to receive payloads for all your triggers. You can set this URL through the [settings](https://app.composio.dev/settings) or by using the API endpoint `api/v1/triggers/setCallbackURL`.

2. **Review Trigger Instructions**: Each trigger may have specific instructions. For example, in Slack, you need to configure our webhook URL in the OAuth app settings.

3. **Enable Trigger for Connected Account**: Use the trigger's configuration schema to enable the webhook URL for a specific connected account. This is done via the API endpoint `api/v1/triggers/enable/{connected_account_id}/{trigger_id}`. The request body should include `{"triggerConfig": {} }`, with all the necessary values as per the trigger's configuration schema. For example, for a GitHub repository webhook, the configuration might look like this:

<CodeGroup>
``` JSON API to get required trigger parameters
"triggerConfig": {
	  "owner": "kaavee315",
	  "repo": "ML_assignment"
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Handling Triggers 

After completing the setup, the specified webhook URL will begin to receive data. 

This data includes the `connected_account_id` for account identification, `trigger_id` for trigger identification, and the `payload`, which adheres to the trigger's specified payload schema.
<CodeGroup>
``` JSON Sample Trigger Webhook, Received on Callback URL
{
	"trigger_name":"github_commit_event",
    "trigger_id":"12310-sadas-12ad-sa",
	"connected_account_id":"64184e1a-76bf-404b-bf8e-e9ce04fd7c9c",
	"payload":{
		"id":"ae4926ca23488ef488e76c8b39e2ad3ae9e58786",
		"message":"Update README.md",
		"timestamp":"2024-03-26T19:36:58+05:30",
		"author":"kaavee315",
		"url":"https://github.com/kaavee315/ML_assignment/commit/ae4926ca23488ef488e76c8b39e2ad3ae9e58786"
	}
}
