### Welcome to Composio

![intro](/media/intro.jpg)

Composio enables agents to execute tasks which require interaction of agent with world outside via APIs, RPCs, Shells, Filemanagers, Browser or üåê.

For instance, to **accomplish** a task like **"Create a new repository on GitHub"**,
your **agent needs to integrate with GitHub's API**.
It involves translating API specifications into functions callable schema,
managing authentication for multiple users and many other things which Composio does out of box.

Agents can now **execute code, interact with your local system, receive triggers or execute action for [150+ external tools](/apps/list).**
