### Managing Actions

<Steps>
<Step title="Get actions for a specific use case">
Get all the actions for a specific use case. You can just copy/paste the actions to your codebase.
  <CodeGroup>
  ```bash Show all actions for a use case
  composio-cli get-actions asana "Do all things related to tasks, spaces, folders etc. in asana" --limit=10
  ```
  </CodeGroup>
  Output:
  ```bash
  Version: 0.2.37
  Path: /Users/karanvaidya/codes/hermes/try_composio_sdk/venv3.12/lib/python3.12/site-packages/composio

  > Actions for asana and use case all actions related to tasks, spaces, folders etc. in asana:

  Action.ASANA_TASKS_GET_MULTIPLE, Action.ASANA_TASKS_GET_TASK_RECORD, Action.ASANA_TASKS_DELETE_TASK, Action.ASANA_TASKS_GET_TASKS_BY_PROJECT, Action.ASANA_TASKS_GET_USER_TASK_LIST_TASKS, 
  Action.ASANA_TASKS_SET_PARENT_TASK, Action.ASANA_TASKS_SET_DEPENDENCIES_FOR_TASK, Action.ASANA_TASKS_ADD_PROJECT_TO_TASK, Action.ASANA_TASKS_ADD_TAG_TO_TASK, Action.ASANA_TASKS_ADD_FOLLOWERS_TO_TASK

  Do you want to copy these enums to the clipboard? (yes/no): 
  ```
</Step>
<Step title="Connecting your preferred tool to Composio">
**Authorise your app account** to enable agent interactions.
  <CodeGroup>
  ```bash Authorise Slack
  composio-cli add slack # Replace 'slack' with any supported app
  ```
  </CodeGroup>
  After completing the authorisation, a new `connected_account` will be created and visible in your dashboard.
</Step>
<Step title="Show all Active Connections for any App">
**View all active connections** for a specific app.
  <CodeGroup>
  ```bash Show currently active connections
  composio-cli show-connections slack # Replace 'slack' with any supported app
  ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Step>
</Steps>
