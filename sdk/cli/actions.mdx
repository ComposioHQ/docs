### Get actions for a use case
Get all the actions for a specific use case. You can just copy/paste the actions to your codebase.
  <CodeGroup>
  ```bash Show all actions for a use case
  composio-cli get-actions asana "Do all things related to tasks, spaces, folders etc. in asana" --limit=10
  ```
  </CodeGroup>
  ```bash
  Version: 0.2.37
  Path: /Users/karanvaidya/codes/hermes/try_composio_sdk/venv3.12/lib/python3.12/site-packages/composio

  > Actions for asana and use case all actions related to tasks, spaces, folders etc. in asana:

  Action.ASANA_TASKS_GET_MULTIPLE, Action.ASANA_TASKS_GET_TASK_RECORD, Action.ASANA_TASKS_DELETE_TASK, Action.ASANA_TASKS_GET_TASKS_BY_PROJECT, Action.ASANA_TASKS_GET_USER_TASK_LIST_TASKS, 
  Action.ASANA_TASKS_SET_PARENT_TASK, Action.ASANA_TASKS_SET_DEPENDENCIES_FOR_TASK, Action.ASANA_TASKS_ADD_PROJECT_TO_TASK, Action.ASANA_TASKS_ADD_TAG_TO_TASK, Action.ASANA_TASKS_ADD_FOLLOWERS_TO_TASK

  Do you want to copy these enums to the clipboard? (yes/no): 
  ```

### Update the enums for apps
We keep updating the enums for apps in our SDK. But, You can also update the enums for the apps you don't find in the SDK.
  <CodeGroup>
  ```bash Update Apps/Actions Enums
  composio-cli update
  ```
  </CodeGroup>
Now you can use the updated enums for the apps in your codebase.

### Update the enums for apps in Beta
To use the apps in beta, you need to update the enums for the apps in beta.
  <CodeGroup>
  ```bash Update Apps/Actions Enums in Beta
  composio-cli update-beta
  ```
  </CodeGroup>
Now, you can use the enums for the apps in beta in your codebase like `App.NOTIONBETA` and so on.
