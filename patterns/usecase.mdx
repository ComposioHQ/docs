composio actions --use-case '<Use Case'
```
</CodeGroup>


This command will display all actions available in Composio that are relevant to the particular use case.

Use case-based action finding in Composio enhances your ability to manage and execute tasks efficiently by providing targeted action lists tailored to your specific needs. By using the --use-case option, you can quickly access the actions relevant to your use case, saving time and improving productivity.
