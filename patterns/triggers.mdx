---

### Prerequisites

1. Get the trigger name and required config from the UI: This step is common across all users.
2. Set the webhook URL: This should be done once for a Composio account.
3. Enable the trigger for the user: This is done for each user.

### Step 1: Set Up the Composio Client

First, initialize the Composio client using your API key.
<CodeGroup>
```python python
from composio import Composio, App

composio_client = Composio(api_key="API_KEY")
```
</CodeGroup>

### Step 2: Define User and Trigger Information

Specify the user and trigger details. Replace entity_id and selected_app with the relevant user ID and app.
<CodeGroup>
```python python

entity_id = "soham"  # Unique user identifier in your app
selected_app = App.GITHUB  # The app you are working with
trigger_name = "github_commit_event"  # Trigger name from Composio UI
trigger_config = {"owner": "ComposioHQ", "repo": "composio"}  # Trigger config from Composio UI
```
</CodeGroup>

### Step 3: Retrieve User Entity and Connection

Get the user entity and check the connection to the specified app.
<CodeGroup>
```python python
entity = composio_client.get_entity(id=entity_id)
connected_account = entity.get_connection(app=selected_app)  # Get connected account
```
</CodeGroup>


### Step 4: Retrieve and Verify Trigger
Fetch the trigger using its name and verify if it exists.

<CodeGroup>
```python python

triggers = composio_client.triggers.get(trigger_ids=[trigger_name])  # Get the triggers

if len(triggers) == 0:
    raise Exception("Trigger not found")  # Handle incorrect trigger name
```
</CodeGroup>

### Step 5: Check for Active Triggers
Check if the trigger is already enabled for the user.

```python python
active_triggers = composio_client.active_triggers.get(
    trigger_names=[trigger_name], connected_account_ids=[connected_account.id]
)

if len(active_triggers) > 0:
    print(f"Trigger {trigger_name} is already enabled")
    exit()

```
</CodeGroup>

### Step 6: Enable the Trigger
Enable the trigger for the user with the specified configuration.

<CodeGroup>
```python python
print("Trigger config - ", trigger_config)

entity.enable_trigger(
    trigger_name=trigger_name, app=selected_app, config=trigger_config
)

print(f"Trigger {trigger_name} enabled")
```
</CodeGroup>



### Ensuring the User is Connected to the App
If the user is not connected to the app, the connection must be established. The following script helps to ensure the user is connected.

<CodeGroup>
```python python
from composio import Composio, App

composio_client = Composio(api_key="API_KEY")

# get the user id
entity_id = "Soham"  # Unique ID for the user
app = App.GITHUB

entity = composio_client.get_entity(id=entity_id)

try:
    print("Checking if user is connected to app...")
    connection = entity.get_connection(app=app)
    if connection:
        print("User is connected to app")
except Exception as e:
    connection = None

if not connection:
    print("No connection found")
    print("Initiating connection...")
    connection_request = entity.initiate_connection(
        app_name=app, redirect_url="https://www.google.com"
    )  # Redirect URL is optional

    if connection_request.redirectUrl:
        print(f"Please visit {connection_request.redirectUrl} to connect {app}")
    else:
        print(f"Please provide your credentials to connect {app}")

    connection_request.wait_until_active(client=composio_client, timeout=60)
    # Polling until connection is active with a 60-second timeout

print(f"User is already connected to {app}")
# Connection object is now available

```
</CodeGroup>


### Conclusion
By following these steps, you can efficiently enable a specific trigger for a user in Composio, ensuring that the necessary app connections are established and maintained. This guide provides a structured approach to managing triggers and connections, enhancing the capabilities of your Composio setup.
