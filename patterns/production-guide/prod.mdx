When deploying your application to production, it is crucial to configure your 
Composio API key correctly to ensure smooth operation. 
Follow these steps to use the Composio SDK in production:

### Step 1: Set Your Composio API Key
Ensure that your COMPOSIO_API_KEY is set as an environment variable in your production environment. 
This can be done through the platform's UI or via your deployment scripts.

### Step 2: Initialize the Composio Client
In your application code, initialize the Composio client using the environment variable for the API key. 
Here is an example in Python:
<CodeGroup>
```python python
import os
from composio import Composio

composio_client = Composio(api_key=os.getenv("COMPOSIO_API_KEY"))
```
```javascript javascript
import { OpenAIToolSet } from "composio-core";

const composio_toolset = new OpenAIToolSet({
    apiKey: process.env.COMPOSIO_API_KEY
});
```
</CodeGroup>

### Step 3: Provide an Entity ID for User-Specific Actions
Whenever you perform actions using the Composio SDK, make sure to provide the entity ID of the user. 
Here is an example of enabling a GitHub commit hook for a user:
<CodeGroup>
```python python
entity = composio_client.get_entity(user_id="user_123")
```
```javascript javascript
entity = composio_client.client.get_entity("user_123");
```
</CodeGroup>
