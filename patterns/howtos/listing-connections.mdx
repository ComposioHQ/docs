### Listing All Connections
To view all the connections associated with your Composio account, use the following command:
<CodeGroup>
```bash bash
composio connections
```
</CodeGroup>

This command will display a comprehensive list of all connections, providing an overview of the various users linked to your account.


### Listing Active Connections
If you only want to see the connections that are currently active, you can use the --active option:
<CodeGroup>
```bash bash
composio connections --active
```
</CodeGroup>
This command filters the list to show only the active connections, making it easier to identify which users are currently active.

### Getting Connection Details
To get detailed information about a specific connection, use the get command followed by the connection ID. For example, to get details of a connection with the ID 123, you would use:
<CodeGroup>
```bash bash
composio connections get 123
```
</CodeGroup>

This command provides detailed information about the specified connection, including its status, configuration, and other relevant details.

### Deleting a Connection
If you need to remove a connection from your account, use the delete command followed by the connection ID. For example, to delete a connection with the ID 456, you would use:
<CodeGroup>
```bash bash
composio connections delete 456
```
</CodeGroup>
This command deletes the specified connection, removing it from your list of integrations.


### Conclusion
Managing connections in Composio is straightforward with the provided commands. 
By listing all connections, filtering for active ones, 
retrieving detailed information, and deleting unnecessary connections, 
you can efficiently manage your users and ensure that your account remains organized and up-to-date.
